# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The "PlanMyTrip" App is the new "thing" on the block when it comes to travelling to favorable weather destinations.  I have been tasked
to assist with enhancing some of the application features to include;

- Create a user interface to select their minimum/maximum weather forecast
- Increase the search coordinates from 1500 to 2000
- Visualize a vacation map for users
- Visualize a vacation itinerary 

The standard data analysis principles were used which includes; (1) Determine the number of rows and columns; 
(2) Data types used; and (3) Is the data readable?
